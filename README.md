# Unity-Snap-Tap

A proof of concept and a slap in the face for lazy developer out there that would rather slap a ban hammer for people that uses null-bind script to achieve a perfect strafe than providing a better industry standard.

You are free to use this code for your project, both commercial and non-commercial nature provided that any changes made on the script are made open source.
